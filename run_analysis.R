# First we need to load dplyr and tidyr packages. Please do it yourself.
#install.packages("dplyr")
#install.packages("tidyr")
#library(dplyr)
#library(tidyr)

# Next step we load all useful data from "Data" folder in our working directory
xtrain <- read.table("Data\\train\\X_train.txt")
ytrain <- read.table("Data\\train\\y_train.txt")
features <- read.table("Data\\features.txt", colClasses = "character")

# So we are ready to do the steps described in the assignment.
# To do the first step: "Merges the training and the test sets to create one dataset"
# we need to load test and train data on labels and measurements and to bind them.

# First we bind test labels and measurements data and get "test" dataset
ytest <- rename(ytest, activity_id = V1)
test <- bind_cols(ytest, xtest)
subject_test <- rename(subject_test, subject_id = V1)
test <- bind_cols(subject_test, test)

# Then we bind train labels and measurements data and get "train" dataset
ytrain <- rename(ytrain, activity_id = V1)
train <- bind_cols(ytrain, xtrain)
subject_train <- rename(subject_train, subject_id = V1)
train <- bind_cols(subject_train, train)

# After all we bind test and train datasets to the single dataset. Fisrt step is done.
merged_data <- bind_rows(test,train)

# We prepair vector containing all desciptive names for variables.
# It would help us later to get only std and mean variables
# and to set descriptive variable names to dataset.
colnames <- c("subject_id", "activity_id", features$V2)

# According to second step: "Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement."
# we get sub set from colnames vector with the only "mean()" and "std()" substrings in the names of features.
subcolnames <- grep("(mean|std)[(]", colnames, value = TRUE)

# Next bit of code designed as workaround to get "mean" and "std" variables when we would create tidy dataset.
# As we know tidy dataset must match 3 rules:
# 1. Each variable forms a column.
# 2. Each observation forms a row.
# 3. Each type of observational unit forms a table.
#
# So we need to separate feature like "tBodyAcc-mean()-Y" in two columns "tBodyAcc-Y" and "mean"
# to do this next string of code splits feature and reorganize so that "mean" or "std" stand
# in the end of feature name and is separated with "--".

# We split subcolnames (colnames only with "mean()" or "std()") by the "-" symbol
splitcolnames <- strsplit(subcolnames,"-")

# Next function is designed to move parts of the splited list elements so that "mean" or "std" would stand
# in the end of feature name and is separated with "--".
movePosition <- function(x){
  if(is.na(x[3])){
    paste(x[1],substr(x[2],1,nchar(x[2])-2), sep = "--")
  } else {
    paste(paste(x[1],x[3], sep = "-"),substr(x[2],1,nchar(x[2])-2), sep = "--")
  }
}

# We call the movePosition function with saplly to aplly it to the list and to convert it back to the vector
# after all this operations our features names transformed from "tBodyAcc-mean()-Y" to "tBodyAcc-Y--mean"
subcolnames <- sapply(splitcolnames, movePosition)

# Here we finish the 2nd step of assignment: "Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement."
# and select from merged data only columns with mean() and std() in columns names.
merged_data <- select(merged_data, c(1:2, grep("(mean|std)[(]", colnames)))

# To complete 3rd step: "Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the dataset"
# we merge our data with activity_labels data by activity_id. Before merging we rename standard V1 and V2
# variables names in activity_labels dataset.
activity_labels <- rename(activity_labels, activity_name = V2)
activity_labels <- rename(activity_labels, activity_id = V1)
merged_data <- merge(activity_labels, merged_data, by.x = "activity_id", by.y = "activity_id", all = TRUE)

# To complete 4th step: "Appropriately labels the dataset with descriptive variable names"
# we rename varibles in our dataset with previously selected and formed names.
names(merged_data) <- c("activity_id", "activity_name", "subject_id", subcolnames)

# To complete first part of 5th step: "From the dataset in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy dataset..."
# we create tidy dataset and transform it so that it complies 3 tridy data rules mentioned before.
# 1) We get rid off activity_id variably thus we already have activity_name
# 2) We put all features (with operations "mean" and "std") in one column and thier values in another
# 3) We separate feature from operation in two columns (rule: every column must contain only one variable)
#
# According to the Hadley Wikham article "Tidy data": "A variable contains all values that measure the same
# underlying attribute (like height, temperature, duration) across units)"
#
# In addition. Description from the mentioned before article helped me to understand what variable is:
# "A general rule of thumb is that it is easier to describe functional relationships between variables
# (e.g., z is a linear combination of x and y, density is the ratio of weight to volume) than between
# rows, and it is easier to make comparisons between groups of observations (e.g.,
# average of group a vs. average of group b) than between groups of columns."
tidy_data <- merged_data %>%
  select(-activity_id) %>%
  gather(variable_operation, value, -(activity_name : subject_id)) %>%
  separate(col = variable_operation, into = c("variable", "operation"), sep = "--")

# To complete second part of 5th step: "...independent tidy dataset with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject."
# To get average we filter only operations with mean, group our tidy dataset and summarise it to get average of the mean value.
tidy_data <- tidy_data %>%
  filter(operation == "mean") %>%
  group_by(variable, activity_name, subject_id) %>% 
  summarise(mean(value))

# To get resulting file we write our tidy dataset to "tidydata.txt" file
write.table(tidy_data, file="tidydata.txt", row.names = FALSE)
